        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <img src="Resources/history-photo.jpg" alt="Nasi Galung History">
        <p>Founded in the heart of Indonesia, Nasi Galung has been a culinary landmark since the early 1970s. Our founder, Pak Galung, started this humble eatery with a vision to share the authentic flavors of Indonesian cuisine with the world. Through decades of dedication, our recipes have been passed down and perfected, creating a unique blend of spices and flavors that have stood the test of time.</p>
        <p>In those early days, the restaurant was just a small warung, a place where locals could gather and enjoy a warm meal. Over the years, Nasi Galung became known for its signature dishes, each prepared with the same care and tradition as in the beginning. The smell of rendang simmering on the stove and the sound of fresh sambal being ground in the mortar have become synonymous with the experience of dining at Nasi Galung.</p>
        <p>Today, we continue to honor our heritage, offering a taste of the past in every bite. Our restaurant is not just a place to eat but a place to experience the rich cultural history of Indonesia. We invite you to join us, to sit at our table, and to be a part of the Nasi Galung family.</p>
